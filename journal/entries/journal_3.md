## Lesson Summary:

In Carpentry 1 we learned how to use a bandsaw. We need to use it on our tool box to shape its sides. Mr. Godfrey first gave us a talk on safety, we need to put our hair up, sleeves back, no hanging fabric or jewelry, and safety glasses on. Then he showed us how to use the bandsaw. Turn on the bandsaw and keep your hands 4 inches from the blade minimum, if you can't then use a push stick to push your wood through the blade. After you finish cutting your wood let the blade stop moving before you grab it and leave the tool. He let us try on some scrap wood. After we were comfortable with the saw we marked the wood for our sides and cut them.
