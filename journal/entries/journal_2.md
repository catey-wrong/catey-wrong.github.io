What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?   

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Asymmetric encryption uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.



Explain the steps of the encryption and decryption process

First you have to encrypt a message by downloading and running the encryption script and ensuring that it was successful. Then you have to commit these files to your repository and push the changes. To decrypt a message you have to first download and run the description script, download your encrypted message, then run the decryption script again. Lastly, verify the decrypted message and commit it to your repository. 



Why is it important that you never share your secret key?

If the wrong person gained access to your private key, they could impersonate you and gain access to your system.
