Summarize the importance of each of these tools

Terminal, git, vim, and Markdown are all very important and have special roles. Terminal is important because it's how you interact with your computer and execute commands. Git is the repository we use to support our websites and it helps us code. Vim is important because it allows us to edit and navigate files. Markdown is important because it allows us to use and add formatting elements.

I am feeling good but I feel that I need more practice to fully be comfortable. I think as the year moves on I feel a lot more confident.


Give advice for future students who are interested in learning them

Practice a lot and experiment with all of the tools. There are a lot of resources that can teach you how to use them.
