##What genre will your game be?
My game will be a casual game with a bit of strategy. It's not a game where there are super high stakes and it won't be that challenging but you will need some strategy as the levels get harder. 

##What are the objectives? Will there be a score? How do you win or lose?
You are a dog trying to corral sheep into a pen 
You run around pushing sheep into a gap at the edge of a field
The sheep are randomly moving around but you can push them
They will drift away if you are not actively pushing them
Every time you get all the sheep in the goal you win that level
Each level the sheep become faster and more will appear
If a sheep leaves the play area its game is over

##How will the player interact with the game?
The player will use the arrow keys to control a dog and the dog will push the sheep into a goal. 

##What features will you include in your MVP?
The sheep will move randomly
The dog can push the sheep but the sheep will drift
Every time the sheep go through the gate you get points
Every time you clear all sheep you start a new, harder level
Sheepâ€™s head goes in direction that its moving
